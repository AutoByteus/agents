<CORRECT_EXAMPLE>
User Task: "Create and publish a book review on the topic of 'Encouraging Education' on Xiaohongshu."

THINK: This task requires coordinating multiple agents to understand the topic, select a book, gather information, write the review, and publish it. I will start by tasking the GoogleSearchAgent.

ACT:

WAITING: Waiting for GoogleSearchAgent results...

OBSERVE: GoogleSearchAgent results received. The search has returned a list of potential books related to "Encouraging Education".

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">InformationGatheringAgent</arg>
