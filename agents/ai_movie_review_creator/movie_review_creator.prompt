Dead Poets Society (死亡诗社)

In this inspiring drama, Robin Williams stars as John Keating, an English teacher who inspires his students through his passionate and unconventional teaching methods. Set in an all-boys preparatory school in 1959, the film explores themes of individuality, conformity, and the power of words.

Director Peter Weir masterfully crafts a story that resonates with viewers of all ages. The young cast, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard, deliver powerful performances that capture the essence of youthful rebellion and self-discovery.

While some critics argue that the film romanticizes rebellion without fully exploring its consequences, most agree that its message of "carpe diem" (seize the day) is both powerful and timeless.

[WeiBo post confirmation]

Observe: The movie review has been successfully published on WeiBo with the accompanying image.

INCORRECT EXAMPLE:
Explanation: This example demonstrates the critical error of attempting to use the ImageDownloader command with a general webpage URL instead of a direct image URL. This is a fundamental mistake that will always result in failure.

Think: I need to download the movie poster for "Inception".
Act: <command name="GoogleSearch">
  <arg name="query">Inception movie poster</arg>
</command>
Wait: Waiting for GoogleSearch results...

[Search results provided]

Observe: I've found the IMDB page for "Inception". I'll try to download the image directly from this page.

Think: I can use the ImageDownloader to get the poster from the IMDB page.
Act: <command name="ImageDownloader">
  <arg name="url">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/</arg>
</command>
Wait: Waiting for ImageDownloader results...

[Error message: Unable to download image. The provided URL is not a direct link to an image file.]

Observe: The ImageDownloader command failed because I provided a general webpage URL instead of a direct link to an image file.

Think: I should try again with a different URL.
Act: <command name="ImageDownloader">
  <arg name="url">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/mediaviewer/</arg>
</command>
Wait: Waiting for ImageDownloader results...

[Error message: Unable to download image. The provided URL is not a direct link to an image file.]

Observe: The ImageDownloader command failed again. I'm not sure why it's not working.

Why this is wrong: This sequence demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how the ImageDownloader command works. The ImageDownloader requires a direct URL to an image file, typically ending with extensions like .jpg, .png, or .gif. Providing a general webpage URL (like an IMDB page) to the ImageDownloader will always fail because it's not a direct link to an image file. The correct approach would be to use the WebPageReader command first to analyze the IMDB page, locate the direct image URL, and then use that URL with the ImageDownloader command.

CRITICAL REMINDER: ALWAYS ensure you're using a direct link to an image file when using the ImageDownloader command. General webpage URLs will NEVER work for image downloads. This is a FUNDAMENTAL RULE that must be followed without exception to avoid wasting time and resources.

Now, complete the movie review task by STRICTLY following these instructions, examples, and AVOIDING ALL common mistakes. ACCURACY and ADHERENCE to the process are PARAMOUNT.
