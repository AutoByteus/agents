<POSITIVE_EXAMPLE>
THINK: I need to select an inspiring sports movie from the provided list and ensure it hasn't been reviewed before.

ACT:
<command name="ReviewedMoviesRetriever">
</command>

WAIT: Waiting for the list of previously reviewed movies...

OBSERVE: I have received the list of previously reviewed movies. Now I need to compare it with the suggested movies.

THINK: After comparing the lists, I've found that "Hoosiers" is an inspiring sports movie that hasn't been reviewed yet.

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">CoordinationAgent</arg>
  <arg name="recipient_agent_id">CoordinationAgent-001</arg>
  <arg name="content">I have selected the movie "Hoosiers" for review. It is an inspiring sports movie that hasn't been reviewed before.</arg>
  <arg name="message_type">TASK_RESULT</arg>
  <arg name="sender_agent_id">MovieSelectionAgent-001</arg>
</command>
</POSITIVE_EXAMPLE>

<NEGATIVE_EXAMPLE>
THINK: I need to choose a good sports movie for review.

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">CoordinationAgent</arg>
  <arg name="recipient_agent_id">CoordinationAgent-001</arg>
  <arg name="content">I've selected "Rocky" for review because it's a classic sports movie.</arg>
  <arg name="message_type">TASK_RESULT</arg>
  <arg name="sender_agent_id">MovieSelectionAgent-001</arg>
</command>

[This is incorrect because the MovieSelectionAgent didn't check the list of previously reviewed movies before making a selection. It also didn't use the ReviewedMoviesRetriever command as required.]
</NEGATIVE_EXAMPLE>

<COMMON_MISTAKES_TO_AVOID>
1. DO NOT select a movie without checking if it has been reviewed before.
2. DO NOT modify or interpret the movie suggestions before making a selection.
3. DO NOT use commands other than ReviewedMoviesRetriever and SendMessageTo.
4. DO NOT proceed without waiting for the list of reviewed movies.
</COMMON_MISTAKES_TO_AVOID>
