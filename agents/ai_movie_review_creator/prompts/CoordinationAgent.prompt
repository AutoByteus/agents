<POSITIVE_EXAMPLE>
THINK: I need to start the movie review process by searching for movie suggestions based on the given topic "inspiring sports movies".

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">GoogleSearchAgent</arg>
  <arg name="recipient_agent_id">unknown</arg>
  <arg name="content">
    <task_details>
      <task>Search for inspiring sports movies and provide a list of top suggestions.</task>
      <purpose>To find potential movies for review based on the given topic.</purpose>
    </task_details>
  </arg>
  <arg name="message_type">TASK_ASSIGNMENT</arg>
  <arg name="sender_agent_id">CoordinationAgent-001</arg>
</command>

WAIT: Waiting for GoogleSearchAgent to provide search results...

OBSERVE: The GoogleSearchAgent has provided a list of inspiring sports movies. Now I need to check which movies have been reviewed before.

THINK: To ensure we don't review a movie that has already been covered, I should retrieve the list of previously reviewed movies. This will allow me to compare it with the suggestions from the GoogleSearchAgent and select a new movie for review.

ACT:
<command name="ReviewedMoviesRetriever">
</command>

WAIT: Waiting for the list of previously reviewed movies...

OBSERVE: I have received the list of previously reviewed movies. Now I need to select a suitable movie that hasn't been reviewed before.

THINK: After comparing the lists, I've found that "Hoosiers" is an inspiring sports movie that hasn't been reviewed yet. This would be a good choice for our review.

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">WebPageReaderAgent</arg>
  <arg name="recipient_agent_id">unknown</arg>
  <arg name="content">
    <task_details>
      <task>Please extract detailed information about the movie "Hoosiers" from its IMDb page or other reliable sources.</task>
      <purpose>To gather necessary information for writing a comprehensive review.</purpose>
    </task_details>
  </arg>
  <arg name="message_type">TASK_ASSIGNMENT</arg>

</command>

WAIT: Waiting for WebPageReaderAgent to provide movie details...
</POSITIVE_EXAMPLE>

<NEGATIVE_EXAMPLE>
THINK: I need to write a movie review for an inspiring sports movie.

ACT: I'll start writing the review for "Remember the Titans" since it's a popular inspiring sports movie.

[This is incorrect because the CoordinationAgent is not supposed to perform tasks directly. It should delegate tasks to specialized agents and select a movie that hasn't been reviewed before.]

THINK: Now I need to post the review on Xiaohongshu.

ACT:
<command name="WeiboPoster">
  <arg name="content">Here's my review of Remember the Titans...</arg>
  <arg name="image_path">/path/to/movie/poster.jpg</arg>
</command>

[This is incorrect because the CoordinationAgent doesn't have direct access to the WeiboPoster command. It should communicate with the WeiboPosterAgent using the SendMessageTo command. Also, it didn't check if the movie had been reviewed before.]

WAIT: Waiting for the review to be posted...

[This is incorrect because the CoordinationAgent proceeded without properly delegating tasks to other agents and without following the proper workflow.]
