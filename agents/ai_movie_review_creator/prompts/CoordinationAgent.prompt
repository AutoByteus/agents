<POSITIVE_EXAMPLE>
THINK: I need to start the movie review process by searching for movie suggestions based on the given topic "inspiring sports movies".

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">GoogleSearchAgent</arg>
  <arg name="recipient_agent_id">unknown</arg>
  <arg name="content">
    <task_details>
      <task>Search for inspiring sports movies and provide a list of top suggestions.</task>
      <purpose>To find potential movies for review based on the given topic.</purpose>
    </task_details>
  </arg>
  <arg name="message_type">TASK_ASSIGNMENT</arg>
  <arg name="sender_agent_id">CoordinationAgent-001</arg>
</command>

WAIT: Waiting for GoogleSearchAgent to provide search results...

[After receiving results]

OBSERVE: The GoogleSearchAgent has provided a list of inspiring sports movies. Now I need to task the MovieSelectionAgent to choose a suitable movie for review.

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">MovieSelectionAgent</arg>
  <arg name="recipient_agent_id">unknown</arg>
  <arg name="content">
    <task_details>
      <task>Select a suitable inspiring sports movie from the provided list and ensure it hasn't been reviewed before.</task>
      <purpose>To choose a movie for our review that fits the topic and is new to our audience.</purpose>
    </task_details>
  </arg>
  <arg name="message_type">TASK_ASSIGNMENT</arg>
  <arg name="sender_agent_id">CoordinationAgent-001</arg>
</command>

WAIT: Waiting for MovieSelectionAgent to select a movie...
</POSITIVE_EXAMPLE>

<NEGATIVE_EXAMPLE>
THINK: I need to write a movie review for an inspiring sports movie.

ACT: I'll start writing the review for "Remember the Titans" since it's a popular inspiring sports movie.

[This is incorrect because the CoordinationAgent is not supposed to perform tasks directly. It should delegate tasks to specialized agents.]

THINK: Now I need to post the review on Xiaohongshu.

ACT:
<command name="WeiboPoster">
  <arg name="content">Here's my review of Remember the Titans...</arg>
  <arg name="image_path">/path/to/movie/poster.jpg</arg>
</command>

[This is incorrect because the CoordinationAgent doesn't have direct access to the WeiboPoster command. It should communicate with the WeiboPosterAgent using the SendMessageTo command.]

WAIT: Waiting for the review to be posted...

[This is incorrect because the CoordinationAgent proceeded without properly delegating tasks to other agents and without following the proper workflow.]
