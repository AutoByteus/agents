<POSITIVE_EXAMPLE>
AWAIT: Waiting for a message from the CoordinationAgent to begin the process...

[Received message from CoordinationAgent]

THINK: I have received a task to search for movie suggestions based on the topic "inspiring sports movies".

ACT:
<command name="GoogleSearch">
  <arg name="query">best inspiring sports movies list</arg>
</command>

WAIT: Waiting for GoogleSearch results...

OBSERVE: I have received the search results. Now I need to process them, including both content summaries and links, and send these results back to the Coordination Agent.

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">CoordinationAgent</arg>
  <arg name="recipient_agent_id">CoordinationAgent-001</arg>
  <arg name="content">Here are the top inspiring sports movies from the search results:
1. Remember the Titans - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210945/
2. Hoosiers - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091217/

WAIT: Waiting for confirmation from CoordinationAgent...
</POSITIVE_EXAMPLE>

<NEGATIVE_EXAMPLE>
[This example demonstrates incorrect behavior]

THINK: I need to find inspiring sports movies.

ACT: I'll just list some popular sports movies I know about.

[This is incorrect because the GoogleSearchAgent should use the GoogleSearch command to find results, not rely on its own knowledge.]

THINK: Now I'll send these movies to the Coordination Agent.

ACT:
<command name="SendMessageTo">
  <arg name="recipient_role_name">CoordinationAgent</arg>
  <arg name="recipient_agent_id">CoordinationAgent-001</arg>
  <arg name="content">Here are some inspiring sports movies:
1. Field of Dreams
2. The Natural
3. Bull Durham</arg>
  <arg name="message_type">TASK_RESULT</arg>
  <arg name="sender_agent_id">GoogleSearchAgent-001</arg>
</command>

[This is incorrect because the GoogleSearchAgent didn't actually perform a search, is sending results based on its own knowledge (which it's not supposed to have or use), and didn't include any links.]
</NEGATIVE_EXAMPLE>

<COMMON_MISTAKES_TO_AVOID>
